Before studying in Fine Art, she also studied in BA Médiation Culturelle de Musiques in La Sorbonne Nouvelle. She is a sound artist working with mixed media.

            Due to her cross-cultural experience, she questions the concept of « standard », and the way people perceive it in her work. She uses sound as a material at the center of her artistic research, as is a personal way to approach the world, by exploring the materiality of sound. Through this process, new realities are revealed. She is also interested in the notion of « composition ». In this case, she constructs her sound work in a deconstructive way, by experimenting with field recording, vocal and instrumental improvisation and creative writing to question listening ways. 
            <br/><br/>
            Her work takes multiform, and is often site-specific, in which the soundscape emerges in combination with immersive technology and visual elements : video, painting and sculpture. She also does live performance within her sound installation, where she gives the freedom to the public to compose their own listening experience.
