const biography_en = `LI Shumeng, born in 1998 in China, she is a sound artist working with mixed media based in Paris. She was graduated from MA École nationale supérieure d'arts de Paris-Cergy, during which she realized an exchange in Central Saint Martins. Before studying in Fine Art, she also studied in BA Médiation Culturelle de Musiques in La Sorbonne Nouvelle. She is a sound artist working with mixed media. Her projects are exhibited in Goldsmiths University of London, Lethaby Gallery of Central Saint Martin, Scène de Recherche of ENS Paris-Saclay and SciencesPo Lille, etc. 
            
Due to her cross-cultural experience, she questions the concept of « standard », and the way people perceive it in her work. She uses sound as a material at the center of her artistic research, as is a personal way to approach the world, by exploring the materiality of sound. Through this process, new realities are revealed. She is also interested in the notion of « composition ». In this case, she constructs her sound work in a deconstructive way, by experimenting with field recording, vocal and instrumental improvisation and creative writing to question listening ways. 
            
Her work takes multiform, and is often site-specific, in which the soundscape emerges in combination with immersive technology and visual elements : video, painting and sculpture. She also does live performance within her sound installation, where she gives the freedom to the public to compose their own listening experience.
